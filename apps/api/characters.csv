Act overly interested
Try to woo your opponent
Compliment everything they say
Constantly gas up your opponent like a hype person
Treat them like a long-lost best friend
Talk like their life coach
Act jealous about everything
Flirt badly and awkwardly
Be incredibly unserious
Speak like a cartoon character
Overreact to everything
Laugh at your own jokes
Talk like you’re sleep-deprived
Pretend everything is extremely dramatic
Speak only in memes or slang
Treat the conversation like it’s life or death
Be aggressively optimistic
Act like nothing makes sense
